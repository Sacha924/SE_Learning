# Software Engineer Knowledge

I'm learning different concepts to develop my skills as a software engineer.
Some concepts are theoretical knowledge (like "how OS work in general"), and others require code to better understand. 
So this github repository will serve me well as a central place for storing and showcasing the code I write as I explore various concepts in software engineering.
