## Basic Explanation:
> When you run npm run xxx, NPM looks in your project's package.json file for a script named xxx and executes it. This is useful because it allows you to define and run custom scripts and commands specific to your project.

## Intermediate Explanation:
> npm run xxx executes a script defined under the scripts section in package.json. It's preferred over directly running scripts because NPM adds node_modules/.bin to the PATH, enabling you to run locally installed packages without specifying their full path. This setup avoids global installations and ensures that the correct version of a tool is used as per the projectâ€™s dependencies.

## Detailed Explanation:
> When npm run xxx is executed, NPM first checks the scripts section in package.json for the xxx script. It then runs this script in an environment where the node_modules/.bin directory is included in the PATH. This inclusion means any executables installed by project dependencies can be run as if they were installed globally. This process is crucial for ensuring consistency across environments, as it relies on project-specific versions of tools rather than globally installed ones. Furthermore, the scripts can include complex command-line instructions that are made simpler and more readable within the scripts section.
